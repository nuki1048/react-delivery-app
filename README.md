This project is a food delivery service similar to Uber Eats or Glovo. It allows users to order food and create a personal profile. Within the personal profile, users can view their order history and update some of their information. The project features a responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop versions (although it's not yet implemented in the personal cabinet).

In this project, I initially used JavaScript and later migrated to TypeScript. Additionally, there's a clever use of cookies that enhances the user experience.

The technologies/libraries used in this project include:

1. TypeScript
2. React
3. Redux
4. Chakra UI
5. Firebase
6. Formik
